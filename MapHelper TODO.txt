Reestructure entire thing.
 - Optimize for "regular" displays first (720p)
 - Dont call "draw", instead, update an Status.
 - Will only redraw on Status update, and on requestAnimationFrame().
 - Give ID to all elements (react compatibility)
 - Allow matrix math to allow rotation and scaling!
 - Add help!
 - Settings per element:
   - Color: DEFAULT or custom
   - Width: DEFAULT or custom
 - Multiple canvas layers:
   - Main canvas container
   - Layer BaseMap (updated only if MapPosition is changed)
   - Layer Lines   (updated only if MapLines is different or BaseMap is updated)
   - Layer Points  (updated only if MapPoints is different or BaseMap is updated)
   - Layer extra (like in-map topo)
   - Popup layer (use HTML instead of canvas)
 

DONE:
 - Use react?



















General:
 - [Priority] Add new maps
 - [Priority] Fix: [Escape] and click on empty do not deselect objects
 - [Priority] Tutorial
 - Render 'hover' lines first.
 - Auto select newly created line/point
 - Allow line/point export/import as json (to save/load)
 - OOOORRRR (and?) make a save/load to localStorage window.
 - Allow line/point export as table format (csv to make calculations on excel)
 - Allow rotation too (change renderer and point mapper to allow matrix transforms)

Performance:
 - [Priority] Remove JQuery!!
 - Optimize canvas write (only map if visible)

Config:
 - Add help menu
 - Add map antialiasing option.
 - Add reset tutorial and reset all.

UI:
 - Add a Popup MessageDisplay that can be selected & copied. Can be used to output text or graphs.

Mobile support:
 - Fix mousemove (map panning) on high res devices.
   - Maybe add a minimun movement required before actually moving. (Save a point on click, and only start moving if a certain distance has been traveled (5px?) from that point.

Line/Point:
 - Fix edit pane not updating on new line creation.
 - [Priority] Point styles (cross, angled line...)
 - [Priority] Deselect topographic points on line deselect.
 - Allow manual input
 - Give a direction indicator (arrow) when hovering an element that is not on screen.
 - Allow moving the points after being placed.
 - Allow moving the points during placement.
 - Allow in-map topographic visualization (plot).
 - Allow free space loss calculation (freq. input).
 - Allow max distance between 2 points calc.
 - Allow default distance configuration (in km, m, miles, nautical miles...)
 - Add a ruler (black and white, like the scale), and display it when adding new line.
 - Add ruler tool (uses said ruler).
